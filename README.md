A collection of Python packages for interfacing hardwares with a RasPi (but not
only).

These packages are primarily intended for robotics activities but can be used
for any other purpose of course.

The repository contains 3 parts :
- pybot/ 

    Contains the Python package, and should be deployed in dist-packages
    directory, or in any other location in the Python search path. 

- bin/
    
    Some command line scripts (for instance, Robotis Dynamixel servos tools) 
    and basic demos

- apps/
    
    Some applications we wrote, based on PyBot library


Enjoy.
