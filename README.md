A collection of Python packages for interfacing hardwares with a RasPi (but not
only).

These packages are primarily intended for robotics activities but can be used
for any other purpose of course.

The repository contains 3 parts :
- lib/ 
    Contains the Python global package, and should be deployed in a directory 
    named "pybot" and located in your dist-packages directory, or in any other
    location in the Python search path. 
    One day it will be packaged in a more academic way, using setup.py. Be
    patient.

- bin/
    Some command line scripts (for instance, Robotis Dynamixel servos tools)

- demo/
    Guess what ;)

Enjoy.
