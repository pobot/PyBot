A set of classes for using ABElectronics RaspberryPi extension boards 
(see https://www.abelectronics.co.uk/default.aspx)

They are designed (the classes, not the boards :)) to provide concepts close to what is manipulated at application level 
(a logical IO, an ADC input, a servo,...), so that it should be more natural for newcomers
than playing at a lower level.
